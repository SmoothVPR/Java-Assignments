# Assignment 1

### Basic lambdas (Sort string array)
- [x] length (i.e., shortest to longest)
- [x] reverse length (i.e., longest to shortest)
- [x] alphabetically by the first character only
- [x] Strings that contain “e” first, everything else second. For now, put the code directly in the lambda.
- [x] Redo the previous problem, but use a static helper method so that your lambda looks like this:
      Arrays.sort(words, (s1,s2) -> Utils.yourMethod(s1,s2))
