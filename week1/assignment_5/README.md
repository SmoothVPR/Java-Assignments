### Lambdas
- [x] Given an array of ints, is it possible to choose a group of some of the ints,  
      such that the group sums to the given target, with this additional constraint:  
      if there are numbers in the array that are adjacent and the identical value,  
      they must either all be chosen, or none of them chosen.
