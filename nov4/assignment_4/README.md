# Assignment 4

- [x] For this exercise you will add JUnit tests for the Line Class
- [x] Create a file called LineTest.java
- [x] Create tests for the getSlope, getDistance and parallelTo methods
- [x] Because of rounding errors, it is bad practice to test double 
      values for exact equality. To get around this, you can pass a 
      small value (such as .0001) to assertEquals to be used as a 
      delta
